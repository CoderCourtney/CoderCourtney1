        <!-- START DESCRIPTION AFTER IMG  -->
        <p> I love solving problems and building great creative projects that will help with efficiency for a business. I love working with great teams to accomplish the most effective web content. </p>
        <p> I have earned a Bachelors of Arts in Theatre Arts, have degrees in Cinema Production, Math and Dance. I have a huge love for the arts but also have that mathematical computation brain with a love for coming up with solutions. I am obsessed with finance and truly believe in following all your passions. I have a YouTube Channel talking about Overcoming Obstacles and created a puppet show called TurnedUP Turnip for kids, but adults love it too. I record all the voices, puppeteer and edit. </p>
        <p> I am excited for my journey in coding! Here are some of my current experiences that I think will help me in my web development learning process:
